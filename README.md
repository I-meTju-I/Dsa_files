Learning advanced data structures and algorithms in C

There are a large number of algorithms designed to efficiently search for elements in dynamic sets: binary search trees,
multiple approaches to their balancing, hash tables and multiple approaches to conflict resolution. Different algorithms
are suitable for different situations according to the nature of processed data, distribution of values, performed operations,
etc. My task in this assignment is to implement and then compare 4 implementations of data structures in terms of the effectiveness
of insert, delete and search operations in various situations:

• Custom implementation of binary search tree (BVS) with arbitrary balancing algorithm, e.g. AVL, Red-Black trees, (2,3) trees,
(2,3,4) trees, Splay trees, ...

• Second own implementation of BVS with a different balancing algorithm than previous point.

• Custom implementation of a hash table with collision resolution. Hashtable size adjustment also needs to be implemented.

•  A second custom hash table implementation with collision resolution in a different way than in the previous point. 
Hashtable size adjustment also needs to be implemented.
